I come to coding pretty late for a career change. Truly, I was getting stagnant in my other job. I wanted to challenge myself but not ready to invest financially in classes so I am trying all the free bootcamps out in cyberspace. The first language I dappled in was Javascript. Not the easiest, and not often link with statistical analysis. If I were to jump into coding as a career, I think my niche would be in data science area. Like analyzing sales or customer satisfaction or the efficacy of some drug. I found Python to be more “forgiving” and more intuitive. Also, I wanted to be on a ladies team, sounds cool to be part of Pyladies.

Here are some of the websites I checked out:

* [EdX](https://www.edx.org) 
* [Future Learn](https://www.futurelearn.com)
* [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com)
* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* [The Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com)
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
* [Get Programming: Learn to code with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/get-programming-learn/9781617293788/)

Organizers' note:
Nancy has been to several Cleveland PyLadies meetups. Her enthusiasm and
willingness to learn is inspiring. She even volunteered to make this change
on camera so that we could make a Git demo for others to learn from! Check out
[her awesome demo on our YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/Yg4l07Z6zZ0) and
follow along if you need guidance or inspiration to make an open-source contribution.
Way to go, Nancy! You rock.
