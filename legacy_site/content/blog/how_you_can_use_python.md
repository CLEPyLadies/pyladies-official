Python is an extremely versatile programming language known for its beginner-friendly syntax.  It is used by NASA, Google, GenomOncology, OnShift, SkipList, Dropbox, Quora, and many others.

Python is great for scripting, the automation of short repetitive tasks.

Here are some examples of libraries people use to solve real-world problems in multiple domains with Python:

*  Web Development - Developers may choose [Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html) or [Flask](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/) for creating dynamic websites, or [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/wiki/Tutorials) for making nicely-formatted static sites.

  *  Scientific Computing - many scientists use [SciPy](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-scipy-tutorial) and [NumPy](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/numpy-tutorial-part1-array-python-examples/) in Physics, Astronomy, Chemistry, and Climatology.

  *  Machine Learning using [Scikit-learn](https://medium.com/@mwitiderrick/introduction-to-supervised-learning-with-python-scikit-learn-tutorial-966457dd33b9), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/), [Keras](https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python) and Deep Learning with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/). Some popular uses of ML and DL include financial analysis, recommendation engines, foreign language translation, and on social media websites.

  *  Data Visualization using [Bokeh](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/responsive-bar-charts-bokeh-flask-python-3.html), [matplotlib](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matplotlib-tutorial-python), [PixieDust](https://github.com/pixiedust/pixiedust/wiki/Tutorial:-Using-Notebooks-with-PixieDust-for-Fast,-Flexible,-and-Easier-Data-Analysis-and-Experimentation) and [Seaborn](https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial) to create elegant charts and plots of data sets and statistics.

No matter which area interests you, pick a problem and break it down into manageable pieces.  Approach it step-by-step.  See what you can find online (Google, StackOverflow, YouTube, documentation) when you get stuck, [come to a meetup](https://www.meetup.com/cle-pyladies/) and be sure to ask for help on Slack [here](https://slackin.pyladies.com/) or [here](https://cleveland-tech.slack.com/)if you've hit an impasse.

There are many other ways to use and apply Python.  What will you build using your awesome programming skills?
