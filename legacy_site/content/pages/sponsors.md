Title: Partnerships

We are grateful for the support of [the Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).

We happily partner with the [Cleveland Python User Group](https://www.clepy.org/) for events, projects, and ideas.

We provide ongoing mentorship for participants of [Django Girls Cleveland](https://www.djangogirls.org/cleveland)

We would love to promote additional partners and sponsors in Northeast Ohio and beyond!
